            <p class="det">I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do,
                to see,
                and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I
                like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like
                to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at
                the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the
                middle of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I
                like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people. I
                like countrys peace, I like metropolis noise; I like the beautiful west lake in Hangzhou, I like the
                flat cornfield in Champaign. I like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like good books and romantic
                movies. I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh..</p>

                <p class="para">In a calculator project in Java, the goal is to create a program that can perform basic
                    mathematical
                    operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This involves taking input
                    from the user, performing the desired operation, and displaying the result. The project often
                    includes a user interface with buttons for different operations and a text field to display the
                    numbers entered and the result. The Java programming language offers various libraries and
                    frameworks that can be utilized to simplify the development process. Overall, the calculator project
                    is a great exercise to practice programming concepts such as input/output handling, conditional
                    statements, and basic mathematical operations. </p>
